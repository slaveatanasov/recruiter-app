# Recruiter App
Portfolio project (MERN stack). As a final project for my diploma for completing the Web Development course at Semos Education in Skopje, I did this project using React.js with Redux, Node.js with Express, MongoDB with Mongoose, implementing RESTful API standards for an app that uses authentication and authorization, and other features.
